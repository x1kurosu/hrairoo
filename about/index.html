<h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>A place to archive what I think about various things, such as monster designs from two specific franchises and perhaps other topics.

I got the idea to do this after reading the entirety of a similar, popular blog.  I disagreed with many opinions there, then I started to think about how I don't agree with anyone that puts their opinions on a site or a video, and so I decided to be the first of my own kind with what I feel is my specific viewpoint.
